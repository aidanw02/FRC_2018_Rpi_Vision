# FRC_2018_Rpi_Vision
"""Please note that this code is in a early development stage and not yet complete!""" 

This Code is Intended to run on a raspberry pi 3 that is conected to the robot radio.
It starts a mjpg server with the three camera streams on it.
Then the smartdash board grabs the streams from the server.
Their are two cameras connected to the RPi.
The third stream is the the same as the second one except with lines added for lining up with objects on the field.
